# printf

printf is a popular and widely-used function in the C programming language for outputting formatted text to the console or other output devices. It allows developers to print strings, numbers, and other data types to the screen or file, with a variety of formatting options such as specifying the number of digits, alignment, and padding. The printf function is included in the standard C library and has become a fundamental tool for debugging, testing, and communicating information to users within C programs.

In this project task me and my patener will attempt to create the our own customize printf. Below is the different task we'll handle.

Task 0: I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life

Task 1:  Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't

Task 2: With a face like mine, I do better in print

Task 3: What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print

Task 4: Nothing in fine print is ever good news
 
Task 5: My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
 
Task 6:How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
 
Task 7: The big print gives and the small print takes away
 
Task 8: Sarcasm is lost in print

Task 9: Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
 
Task 10:The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
 
Task 11: It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
 
Task 12:  Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection
 
Task 13:  Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
 
Task 14: The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring
